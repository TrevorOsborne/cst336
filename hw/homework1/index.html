                <p>     The atmosphere of technology and research today is pushing 
                for smarter and more autonomous solutions to everyday problems 
                and routines. One area of popular interest is Unmanned Air 
                Vehicles (UAVs) operated remotely, which are part of a larger 
                unmanned air system (UAS).</p>
                
                <p>     The area of operation, size of the unmanned vehicle, network
                resources and availability, and volume of other UAVs present, 
                are all factors to consider when researching and optimizing a 
                UAS. Something like this would require state of the art 
                technology and a sophisticated network system to employ 
                efficiently and safely.</p>
