                Communication for UAS</i></h3> <br />
                <p>     Typical UASs have incorporated ground-to-UAV 
                communication techniques. Recent advancements have shown that 
                integrating UASs into 5G cellular systems is a promising 
                technology that can achieve valuable goals in terms of 
                reliability, security, range of operation, and 
                throughput (Zeng, 2019). Line of sight and other ground 
                obstacles have traditionally been drawbacks with ground-to-UAV 
                network communications.</p>

                <p>     This could eventually be overcome with mechanisms from 
                Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G networks. Additionally, 
                dedicated UAVs such as helkiteâ€™s and balloons could be 
                dispatched as an aerial communication platform to assist with 
                terrestrial communications in 5G. These devices are referred to 
                as UAV-assisted 5G communications and could be useful for 
                information dissemination, data collection, and machine-type 
                communications. These communication platforms could be useful 
                for swift service-recovery after natural disasters.</p>
