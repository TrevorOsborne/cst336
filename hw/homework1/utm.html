                (UTM)</i></h3> <br />
                
                <p>     UTM is a new system that the U.S. federal government 
                has had to compile quickly to deal with the recent boom in 
                private and commercial UAV activity. It’s a traffic management 
                ecosystem that connects all UAVs in a large operational are. 
                The basic idea is that a large amount of commercial UAV activity 
                can be incorporated into this UTM using established flight 
                plans. Most of these UAV operations can be preplanned and stick 
                to a predetermined flight path/schedule and still achieve the 
                user’s desired purpose. </p>
                
                <p>     With a well-organized UTM, every new flight plan entry 
                could be queued and ensured separation from other scheduled UAV 
                flights. This UTM could also be collaborated with the Federal 
                Aviation Administration (FAA) traffic management unit. UAV 
                flight plans could be augmented to avoid any interference with 
                aircraft in the National Air Space (Federal Aviation 
                Administration, 2017). UTM is an interesting type of UAS that 
                could be an effective means to organize the network of most UAV 
                activity.</p>
