                <p>     In mobile and vehicular networks, the nodes join and 
                dissociate from the network frequently. Ad hoc networks have 
                been found most suitable for these situations. Researchers are 
                trying to determine if the same approach could be used for UASs.
                Some of the primary concerns with using traditional ad hoc 
                networks in mobile or vehicle nodes are UAV’s ability to travel 
                randomly or in an organized swarm not only in 2 but in 3 
                dimensions. Vehicular nodes are constrained to 2-dimensional 
                road travel.</p>
                
                <p>     Topology changes are much more frequent in UASs. UAV’s 
                can malfunction and fall off the network or lose power and must 
                land for recharging. Links may form and vanish because of nodes 
                changing position. Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) stations that 
                are locked on to a particular UAV for communication access would 
                need to be transferred to another UAV seamlessly, without 
                disrupting user sessions (Gupta, Jain, and Vaszkun, 2015). 
                Researchers are still finding out the most effective routing 
                protocol to handle these situations as well as a seamless 
                handover procedure.</p>
